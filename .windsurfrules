Here are clear rules to ensure the AI adheres to the project's requirements and avoids hallucinating details or deviating from your specifications:

---

### **General Rules for This Project**
1. **Predefined Users Only**:
   - Do not introduce or allow for new user creation beyond the four predefined users.
   - Authentication uses JWT tokens but does not require email or password. JWT tokens are simply identifiers tied to predefined user IDs.

2. **Persistent Host Tracking**:
   - Always save the host’s `userID` and `name` in the `Auction` database.
   - Host identification must persist across server restarts, even if the host’s JWT changes or becomes invalid.
   - The host should retain exclusive controls (`Start Auction`, `Delete Auction`, `Pause/Resume Auction`, etc.) for their created auctions.

3. **Player Data Management**:
   - Import **exactly 1000 players** from the CSV file, ensuring:
     - At least 20 goalkeepers.
     - At least 200 defenders.
     - At least 400 midfielders.
     - The remaining 380 players are attackers.
   - Players are categorized by tiers (`Gold`, `Silver`, `Bronze`, `Elite`):
     - Each tier has a minimum bid: 
       - Bronze: 10 Ghanta Coins (GC).
       - Silver: 25 GC.
       - Gold: 50 GC.
       - Elite: 75 GC.
   - The CSV import process automatically assigns these tiers, positions, and minimum bids.

4. **Auction Logic**:
   - Auctions are classified into three statuses:
     - **Pending**: Created but not started.
     - **Active**: In progress.
     - **Completed**: Finished.
   - Auctions must include the following controls:
     - **Host-only controls**:
       - Start Auction.
       - Pause/Resume Auction.
       - End Auction.
       - Delete Auction (only when the auction is in Pending status).
       - Next Player.
     - **User controls**:
       - Join Auction (only if not already joined and the auction is Active).
       - View Auction (for any auction status).

5. **Player Selection for Auction**:
   - Players are divided into:
     - **Available for Auction**: Visible and selectable by users for bidding.
     - **Not Available for Auction**: Hidden from selection and bidding.
   - Each user has a page to select or deselect players for auction.
   - Default selections should be pre-configured but modifiable by users.

6. **Squad and Sub Management**:
   - The **profile page** for each user contains:
     - **Main XI**: The user’s top 11 players.
     - **Squad**: All players won by the user in previous auctions.

7. **Player Cards**:
   - Player cards must include:
     - Name, position, and tier.
     - Minimum bid for the player.
     - Player stats displayed as a radar chart.

8. **Stats and Insights**:
   - User stats must track:
     - Total auctions participated in.
     - Average coins spent per auction.
     - Biggest bid made.
     - Most frequently bought players.
   - Auctioned player stats must track:
     - Total time elapsed for the auction.
     - Winning bids for each player.
     - Owner of the player after the auction.

9. **UI and Navigation**:
a   - Display server connection status and connected users using sockets.
     - Status bar should auto-hide but be accessible for troubleshooting.
   - **Auctions Page**:
     - List all auctions with filters: Pending, Active, Completed.
     - Allow viewing, joining, and hosting auctions as per rules.
   - **Player Database**:
     - Display all players with search and filter options (by position and tier).
   - **Selected Players Page**:
     - Allow users to modify their selection of players for the auction.

10. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**:
    - Ensure the system prevents unauthorized actions:
      - Only the host can perform host-specific actions.
      - Users cannot join an auction multiple times or join a completed auction.
    - Handle server restarts gracefully:
      - Ensure host identity, auction status, and player assignments persist.
      - Use database-driven logic to ensure consistent state retrieval.

12. **Terminology Consistency**:
    - Always use the correct terminology:
      - "Main XI" instead of "Team Players."
      - "Squad" instead of "Won Players."
      - "Ghanta Coins" (GC) as the currency.
      - "Host" for the creator of the auction.

### **Fallback Rules for Ambiguities**
- If instructions are unclear, **ask for clarification** instead of assuming or hallucinating details.
- Follow established standards (e.g., RESTful APIs, MongoDB schema design) unless explicitly directed otherwise.
- Prioritize functionality over aesthetics unless otherwise specified.
